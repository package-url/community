# Community
Repository for discussions and decisions related to Package-URL as a 
community including:
- Governance,
- Outreach (calendars, mailing lists, messaging platforms, etc.),
- Documentation, and
- Other topics than affect both the PURL and VERS specifications.

The initial focus is on improving the community and project
infrastructure for the PURL (purl-spec) and VERS (vers-spec) specifications,
but we will want to offer Package-URL community resources to any
project hosted under the package-url organization.
