## PURL Specification Update - July 31, 2025

### **Progress**

* Closed 14 issues, merged 16 pull requests, and closed 13 pull requests without merge (e.g., because the pull request was replaced or superseded by another pull request).  
* Added JSON Schema files for PURL Type definitions and PURL tests \- this was a critical path item for the Ecma standard  
* Re-organized the purl-spec repository to add the JSON Schemas and apply related changes  
* Moved VERS specification files to a new separate repository: package-url/vers-spec

### **Plans for August**

* Complete PURL v1.0 Ecma standard for submission to Ecma  
* Complete restructuring the purl-spec repo   
  * Convert documentation files from rST to markdown format for easier contributor access and use in the new Package-URL website  
  * Move documentation from the PURL-SPECIFICATION.rst and PURL-TYPES.rst files to more granular markdown files with a clear distinction between files that are for the Ecma standard and those that are for the broader specification  
* Create template(s) and update documentation for submitting requests to register a new PURL Type  
* Process at least 10 requests to register a new PURL Type  
* Complete first version of vers-spec/schemas/vers-test.schema.json
